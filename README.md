# Vagabond - Pulp Fantasy Roleplaying Game

This is an non-official adaptation for Foundry VTT of **Indestructoboy's (Taron Pounds)** RPG system, **Vagabond**. 

Vagabond is a high-octane, tactical, and brutal fantasy RPG. This system implementation focuses on automating the crunch so you can focus on the punch, featuring custom HUDs, grid-based inventory management, and tactical spellcasting calculators.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🛡️ Tactical Character Sheet
The character sheet is designed for tactical play. It features a **Sliding Panel** design that keeps your main stats visible while allowing deep dives into features, spells, and effects.
- **Grid-Based Inventory**: Items occupy specific slots in your inventory grid. Drag and drop to rearrange your gear or context-click to equip/unequip items instantly.
- **Automated Fatigue**: Track fatigue levels visually with interactive skull icons.

### ⏱️ HUD Overlays: Clocks & Countdown Dice
Track tension and time directly on the canvas without needing external modules.
- **Progress Clocks**: Create clocks with 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 segments. Position them in any corner of the screen to track long-term goals or impending doom.
- **Countdown Dice**: Visual representations of dice (d4-d20) that tick down. Perfect for tracking volatile effects or dwindling resources.

### ⛺ Downtime Manager
Vagabond emphasizes the struggle of the journey. The built-in **Downtime Manager** automates the logistics of survival.
- **Resting**: Calculates lodging costs automatically based on quality (Squalid to Aristocratic) and updates HP, Mana, and Luck.
- **Hunting & Foraging**: Built-in loot tables for hunting game or foraging for supplies, automatically rolling for yield.
- **Crafting & Studying**: Track progress on crafting projects or gain "Studied Dice" for future rolls.

### 🔥 Tactical Spellcasting
Magic in Vagabond is flexible and dangerous. The system includes a dynamic **Mana Calculator**:
- **Inline Customization**: Adjust Damage Dice, Delivery methods (Cone, Line, Aura, etc.), and Range extensions on the fly.
- **Auto-Calculation**: The sheet automatically calculates the total Mana cost based on your modifications, ensuring you never miscalculate the price of power.
