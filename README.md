### Clocks & Countdown Dice
Track tension and time directly on the canvas without needing external modules.
- **Progress Clocks**: Create clocks with 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 segments. Position them anywhere to track long-term goals or impending doom.
- **Countdown Dice**: Create the countdice and never forget to roll when the time comes!

### Downtime Manager
Vagabond emphasizes the struggle of the journey. The built-in **Downtime Manager** automates the logistics of survival.
- **Resting**: Calculates lodging costs automatically based on quality (Squalid to Aristocratic) and updates HP, Mana, and Luck.
- **Hunting & Foraging**: Built-in loot tables for hunting game or foraging for supplies, automatically rolling for yield.
- **Crafting & Studying**: Track progress on crafting projects or gain "Studied Dice" for future rolls.

### Awesome Freeform Spellcasting
Magic in Vagabond is flexible and unique. The system includes a dynamic **Mana Calculator**:
- **Fast and Magical**: Adjust Damage Dice, Delivery methods (Cone, Line, Aura, etc.), and Range extensions on the fly.
- **Auto-Calculation**: The sheet automatically calculates the total Mana cost based on your modifications, ensuring you never miscalculate the price of power.
- **Templates**: target anything and click in the delivery range in the shat card to automatically draw a measure template in the canvas.
