## Key Features

### New Character Sheet Styles: Light and Dark Themes

<img width="879" height="905" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28b14f20-b3ee-4559-802a-1f0ee47a084e" />

<img width="1327" height="909" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acd67bde-f160-4657-8ee5-b9df30f20d30" />

<img width="1350" height="820" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c354cfc-f2a3-4616-be9c-828b795d836b" />

Click on the right margin of the top sheet to open it! 

To alternate between the styles toggle the Application style:

Game settings >> Core >> Configure interface >> Applications.

It does not affect Foundry appearance, only in game dialogs and theme.

### Combat Encounters
Dedicated combat encounters with per factions separation: Heroes, NPCs, Neutrals and Secrets (set these in Token >> Appearance >> Token Disposition), with settings to add custom initiative for going in order or through "popcorn initiative" where the table decides the order at will.

### Clocks & Countdown Dice
Track tension and time directly on the canvas without needing external modules.
- **Progress Clocks**: Create clocks with 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 segments. Position them anywhere to track long-term goals or impending doom.
- **Countdown Dice**: Create the countdice and never forget to roll when the time comes!

- **Resting**: Calculates lodging costs automatically based on quality (Squalid to Aristocratic) and updates HP, Mana, and Luck.
- **Hunting & Foraging**: Built-in loot tables for hunting game or foraging for supplies, automatically rolling for yield.
- **Crafting & Studying**: Track progress on crafting projects or gain "Studied Dice" for future rolls.

- **Fast and Magical**: Adjust Damage Dice, Delivery methods (Cone, Line, Aura, etc.), and Range extensions on the fly.
- **Auto-Calculation**: The sheet automatically calculates the total Mana cost based on your modifications, ensuring you never miscalculate the price of power.
- **Templates**: target anything and click in the delivery range in the shat card to automatically draw a measure template in the canvas.

<img width="1527" height="932" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/131fd4ec-5f9f-41b5-9c77-a838de80dd2f" />

Want some tokens and doesn't have a problem with Ai images? Install this module too:

```

You will need to also install the Too Many Tokens - DnD module that takes a bit of a space. in general you cant install this in services like Forge, but its a good alternative in a pinch. 
No, installing the online version will not work, at least not yet...
